## Project Objectives
1. Develop basic feedforward neural networks for classification or regression for a pre-cleaned dataset having at least a 100 rows and at least 3 input features using existing libraries such as Keras and Tensorflow.
1. Understand how the trained model predicts by implementing a function that serves as the model.

## Evaluation Criterion
1. Effort to study the importance of each input feature (data analysis)
    - For example, plot each input feature against output and document your findings
1. Effort to compare the results of the neural network with a linear regression or logistic regression model?
    - Start with a basic model and then grow your model into a multi-layered model
    - Document your performance comparison
1. Effort to study performance difference when linear activation is used instead of sigmoid (and vice versa)?
   - How does your performance change when linear activations are used instead of sigmoid, in the last neuron and all other neurons.
1. Effort to evaluate your predictions
1. Effort to code a function that represents your model
   - After your model is trained, read all the weights, and build your own function/method that serves as the model
   - Verify that predictions you obtain are same as the one you obtained using your trained model
1. Effort to develop a 'reproducible' code
   - Someone else must be able to reproduce all your results
1. Effort to document all the steps above
